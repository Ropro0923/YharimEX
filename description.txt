Thanks to 永恒群冠 and 我在风中凌乱啊 for making the original fight.
Thanks to the Fargo's Souls team for making the mod.
Thanks to the Calamity team for making the sprites.
For these people, any inquiries or concerns can be sent to Ropro0923

The point of this mod is to port the 1.4.3 fight to 1.4.4, I am not using the sprites and the boss with malicious intent, just renewing an old mod.
